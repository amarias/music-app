# Music Web App
Ongoing personal project designed to create a song using only preset original sounds. 

Check out the [live](http://musicapp.allisonmarias.com/) website. More features coming soon.

# :musical_note: How It Works
There are 3 tracks, each 60 seconds long. Drag and drop different sounds and create a new song. 
On the bottom right corner, you can see the visualizations your song creates. All sounds are original and composed by me.

<sub>*Some of these features have not been implemented yet*</sub>
